// 1. Write a program that converts upper case to lower
char upper_to_lower(char ch);

// 2. Write a program to calculate the area of Circle
float area_of_circle(float radius);

// 3. Given two character inputs, find number of characters between them. For example, if input is ‘A’ and ‘E’ the output is 3
int char_between_char(char ch_1, char ch_2);

// 4. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
float celsius_to_fahrenheit(float temperature);

// 5. Check if entered number is even or odd
unsigned int odd_or_even(int num);

// 6. Check if entered year is leap year or not
int check_leap_year(int year);

// 7. WAP to find power of 2^N using left shift operator
int pow_of_2(int raise);

// 8. Check if given input is a character or integer. (Use integer input within the range 0-9)
int char_or_int(char ch);

// 9. Generate two random numbers and find its sum (Hint: use rand() from stdlib.h)
unsigned int add_rand(unsigned int x, unsigned int y);

// 10. Enter a 5 digit number and find the sum of its digits. For E.g. if int number = 12345; then sum = 15;
unsigned int sum_of_digits(unsigned int num);

// 11. Write a program to reverse the number. For E.g. If int number = 12345; then the output reverse = 54321;
unsigned int reverse_of_num(unsigned int num);

// 12. Write a program to count the occurrences of a digit in a number.
unsigned int count_digit(unsigned int num, unsigned int digit);

// 13. WAP to check if a given number is a palindrome. For e.g. 12321, 56788765;
unsigned int check_palindrome(unsigned int num);

// 14. Generate the first 'N' prime numbers. For Eg. If N=5 then 2,3,5,7,11
unsigned int is_prime(unsigned int num);

// 15. Write a C program to display and find the sum of the series 1+11+111+....111 up to n.
// For eg. if n=4, the series is: 1+11+111+1111. Take the value of 'n' as input from the user

// 7. A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of the digits of the
// number is equal to the number. For example 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3. Write a C
// program that asks the user to enter a number and returns if it is Armstrong or not.

// 8. Amicable numbers are found in pairs. A given pair of numbers is Amicable if the sum
// of the proper divisors (not including itself) of one number is equal to the other number
// and vice – versa.
// For example 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. First we find the proper divisors of
// 220:
// 220:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110; 1+ 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55
// + 110 = 284
// Now, 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142; 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220
// Write a C program to check that the input pair of numbers is amicable

// 9. Write a menu driven program to read two integers & find their sum, difference & product.

// 10. Write a C program to calculate the volume of the following shapes: Cube, Cuboid,
// Sphere, Cylinder and Cone. Ask the user which one s/he wants to calculate, and take
// the appropriate required inputs. Then print the result. The input should be taken in the
// main function and calculations for every solid should be done in a separate function
// by passing appropriate arguments.
// Example: If the user chooses the option for cube, only one input is required i.e., the
// side. The volume is then calculated and printed.
// If the user chooses the option for cuboid, only three inputs are required i.e., length,
// breadth and height. The volume is then calculated and printed.

// 11. An Electricity board charges the following rates for use of electricity.
// For the First 200 units : Rs 5 per unit
// For the next 100 units : Rs7 per unit
// Beyond 300 units : Rs 10 Per unit.
// Write a C Program to read no of units consumed and print out total charge amount
